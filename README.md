# Card-War-Game
- A two-player game, whoever gets the highest card wins the round, if they tie it means there is a war. The players are given other different cards who ever gets the highest wins the war.
- If there is ever to be a case where the players tie the 2nd time after the 1st time, then they will settle the war by playing (Rock, Paper, Scissor). Who ever wins takes the points.
